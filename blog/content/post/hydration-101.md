Dehydration is the number one enemy of all levels of athletes. The way
you hydrate makes the greatest impact on your training, performance
and recovery. A daily water intake (including from food) of 3.7L (~ 1
gallon) for adult men and 2.7L (0.7 gallon) for adult women meets the
needs of most of people (1), while endurance sports and heat stress
can greatly increase daily water needs. For example, endurance
athletes can sweat 1 to 2L (34–67 oz) per hour and elite athletes can
sweat 4L (~ 1 gallon) per hour in extreme conditions. Our bodies also
lose 900 to 1400 mg of sodium per liter of sweat (2) in addition to a
number of different electrolytes, including chloride, potassium,
magnesium, and calcium, which are essential to maintain a functional
body. The water and electrolytes lost in sweat must be replaced
quickly to prevent an imbalance in body fluids and enhance exercise
performance.
 
## Dehydration

Dehydration is defined as losing more than 1% of body weight (BW) due
to fluid loss. Severe dehydration is defined as losing greater than 3%
of BW. Even a small amount of dehydration in athletes can reduce their
strength, endurance, coordination, mental acuity and
thermoregulation. Thirst starts when 1–2% of BW has already been
lost. In severe case of dehydration, recovery can take up to 18–24
hours even with good rehydration treatments (3).

## How much you need to drink?

It is hard to calculate the needs of fluid replacement during exercise
since the amount varies by environmental factors, such as temperature,
humidity, solar radiation and barometric pressure, and
physiological/anatomical factors like your metabolic rate, core
temperature, skin temperature, body mass and body surface area
(5). Recommended volumes are 8–16 oz 1–2 hour before exercise, 4–8 oz
for every 15 min during exercise and 24 oz after exercise for every
pound of weight loss (3, 11). You can gradually learn how well you are
hydrating by weighting yourself before and after your exercise in
different conditions. Such feedback will develop a better sense of how
much to drink for different intensity levels and environments.
 
## Sodium; A key electrolyte in the blood circulation

Among the electrolytes lost by sweating, sodium is the most critical
chemical for normal body function. Your body loses about 900 to 1400
mg of sodium per liter of sweat (1). Sufficient blood sodium is
essential to maintain a sufficient volume of water in the
blood. Sodium intake during your exercise should also help prevent
water intoxication (hyponatremia), a condition in which the
concentration of sodium in the blood becomes dangerously low. Since
sodium loss in sweat is variable, it is hard to estimate how much
sodium to consume. However, visible salt crystals on the skin or
frequent urination can be signs of losing sodium. When you are losing
a lot of salt and just drinking water, you may dehydrate yourself
because your kidneys sense the diluted sodium levels and begin
filtering excess water to let you pee more. Of course, trained
athletes know that adding sodium in their drink during the exercise is
a good practice but finding a perfect drink is challenging because not
all sports drinks have enough sodium but excess sugar and
additives. That is way I started to make my own hydration powder mix.
 
## Sports drink

I’ve never liked sports drinks, which are syrupy sweet with vivid
colors and artificial flavors. Although sports drinks are intended to
restore the fluid balance more quickly than water, replenish the
electrolytes lost in sweat and provide glucose that quickly fuels
working muscles, most drinks do not provide enough sodium and contain
an excess amount of sugar and other additives, which may cause
gastrointestinal (GI) distress.

## Gatorade and Powerade

For example, 12 oz of Gatorade has 21 g (6%) of sugar, a combination
of sucrose (table sugar) and glucose, and 160 mg of sodium and 45 mg
of potassium. Same volume of Powerade has 6% of high fructose corn
syrup (HFCS), 150 mg of sodium and 35 mg of potassium. If you wish to
recover 900 mg of sodium that is lower end of sodium loss in 1 L of
sweat, you need to drink more than you can carry, 68 oz of Gatorade or
72 oz of Powerade. You also end up consuming 118–126 g of sugar.

## Sugar types matter

When you drink too much sugar and calories, the osmotic pressure in
the stomach goes up and the consumed fluid draws water into the
stomach, resulting in slow fluid absorption and GI distress
(12). Common types of sugar found in sports drinks are sucrose,
glucose, fructose and maltodextrin, a chain of glucose
molecules. Drinking large amounts of fructose and maltodextrin is
known to dehydrate the body since both increase osmotic pressures in
the small intestine, where 95% of water absorption occurs, so that
body pulls water out of the blood into the intestinal cavity. On the
other hand, glucose is necessary to absorb water and sodium
efficiently because the intestinal glucose transporter is the major
player to absorb water and sodium along with glucose. In fact, about
50% of water absorption in human body relies on this pathway
(4). Sucrose is digested to glucose and fructose in the small
intestine. When sucrose (or fructose) is ingested along with glucose,
the mixed sugar is utilized more efficient than single sugar in the
body (13).

## Skratch Lab

So the simple solution is drinking a beverage that has more sodium and
less sugar consisting of glucose and sucrose when you sweat a lot. One
of brands I like is Skratch Labs Hydration Mix. A 16 oz serving
Skratch Labs hydration mix (powder) has more sodium (360 mg) and less
(4%) sugar than other brands. Other electrolytes contained in 16 oz
serving are 40 mg of potassium, 49 mg of calcium, 45 mg of
magnesium. The concentrations of electrolytes besides sodium are
chosen to be similar to the compositions of sweat. The amount of sugar
seems to maximize both water and sugar absorption without GI
discomfort (5). The 900 mg of sodium can be replenished with 40 oz of
drink including 50 g of sugar.
 
 
## Energy drinks

It should be noted that energy drinks, such as Red Bull and Rockstar,
are completely different from sport drinks. These drinks have caffeine
that accelerate dehydration and increase blood pressure, too much
sugar (1% in Red Bull and 13% in Rockstar) that can slow the rate at
which water is absorbed into the bloodstream and lead to GI distress,
and no electrolytes that you need to replenish during and after
exercise. Do not drink any energy drinks immediately before or during
your exercise for your safety.

## Hydration guidelines

Good sports drinks hydrate body, replenish electrolytes and fuel
muscles. However, sports drinks can increase risks of chronic diseases
(such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes) if you regularly drink them
at home and work. Choose your drink depending on the duration and
intensity of the physical activity and on how much you sweat.

- Drink before you feel thirsty.
- Drink water when you workout for 1hr or less.
- Drink a sports drink (or sodium added water) when you workout more than 1 hr at high intensity.
- Drink 8–16 oz 1–2 hour before exercise, 4–8 oz for every 15 min during exercise and 24 oz after exercise for every pound of weight loss.
- Do not drink energy drinks before and during your exercise.
