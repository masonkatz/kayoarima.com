﻿When you are dehydrated, your athletic abilities, including strength, endurance, coordination, mental acuity and thermoregulation, are decreased. Hyperhydration is a method created by Van Rosendal et al (1) aiming to increase body water content before exercise in case that dehydration cannot be prevented when starting from a state of euhydration (the normal state of body water content). 


## Benefits


From this hyperhydrated status, athletes have a greater capacity to tolerate fluid loss before becoming dehydrated. Furthermore, excess pre-exercise fluid intake enhances thermoregulatory ability, as well as increasing blood plasma volume to maintain cardiac output. 


## Method

A hyperhydrated status is difficult to create since a large fluid intake is typically accompanied by diuresis. However, glycerol-containing beverages can create an osmotic gradient in the circulation favoring fluid retention and facilitating hyperhydration. The recommend dose consuming in a period of 60 to 30 minutes before exercise is glycerol 1.2 g/kg (0.55 g/lb) BW in 26 ml/kg (0.4 oz/lb) BW of fluid. During exercise, taking glycerol 0.125 g/kg (0.06 g/lb) BW in 5 ml/kg (0.08 oz/lb) BW during may delay dehydration. After exercise, adding glycerol 1.0 g/kg (0.45 g/lb) BW to each 1.5 L (50 oz) of fluid will accelerate the restoration of plasma volume. For example, if your weight is 170 lb, take 5 tbsp of glycerol in 0.5 gallon of fluid before exercise, ½ tbsp in 14 oz of fluid during exercise and 4 tbsp in 50 oz of fluid after exercise. 


## Glycerol


Glycerol is a colorless, odorless, viscous liquid that is widely used as a sweetener, humectant and solvent in food and pharmaceutical industries. Possible side effects of 
Ingesting glycerol are nausea, GI discomfort and light–headedness.
