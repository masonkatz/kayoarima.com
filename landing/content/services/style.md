My Cooking Style is based on Japanese and Mediterranean cuisine. In
addition to both being known as balanced diets, Japanese food is rich
in dietary fiber and fermented foods while Mediterranean food is rich
in healthy fats including olive oil, nuts and seeds.  Combining a
variety of seafood, meats and beans with colorful vegetables and
fruits creates healthy, beautiful and tasty meals.

Cooking demonstations and cooking classes are available by request. I
can also create a fun cooking party for you and your friends and familty in
your home.
