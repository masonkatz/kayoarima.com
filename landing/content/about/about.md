My Goal is your health for life. I let you control your appetite, food
choices, and everyday meals with the backing of cutting edge
science. Read useful information, such as why you don't need to
[count calories](http://blog.kayodiet.com/2016/05/23/calorie-counting-is-not-necessary/),
what
[phytic acid](http://blog.kayodiet.com/2016/05/23/phytic-acid---friend-and-foe-nutrient/)
is and more in my [blog](http://blog.kayodiet.com).

I was born and raised in Japan, where I received a bachelor degree in
Nutritional Science and certification as a registered dietitian. In
the US, I received a PhD in Nutritional Science and Genetics from the
University of Arizona, and worked at UC Irvine and UC San Diego as a
bio-researcher.

My Diet has two focal points:

* Diet for your gut microbiome: Our gut has tens of trillions of
  microorganisms with more than three million genes (150 times more
  than in humans), which are deeply involved in our health. When your
  microbiome goes out of balance, you increase your potential risks
  for depression, anxiety, obesity, diabetes, and even cancer. My diet
  aims at balancing your microbiome with prebiotics (dietary fiber)
  and probiotics (fermented foods).

* Thinking about physiology: The same foods can be either medicine or
  poison depending on your physical condition. Letâ€™s find the right
  combination and timing of foods suitable for your lifestyle.
