I was born and raised in Japan, where I received bachelor degree in
Nutritional Science and certification as a registered dietitian. In
the US, I received PhD in Nutritional Science and Genetics from the
University of Arizona, and worked at UC Irvine and UC San Diego as a
bio-researcher.

My Cooking Style is based on Japanese and Mediterranean cuisine.In
addition to both being known as balanced diets, Japanese food is rich
in dietary fiber and fermented foods while Mediterranean food is rich
in healthy fats including olive oil, nuts and seeds.  Combining a
variety of seafood, meats and beans with colorful vegetables and
fruits creates healthy, beautiful and tasty meals.
